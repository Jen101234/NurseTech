<p class= "AboutMe">

  My name is Jennelle, a 14 year old girl, who has just started her process into coding. I am very glad that I had been given this opportunity to create a website on a topic which I am extremely passionate about. I live in a small country named Belize. Belize is small country in Central America and we have the second largest barrier reef in the world. Belize is such a beautiful country, however we are still a little bit behind when it comes to technology, especially in our healthcare system. I decided to make a website on this social problem because it has a very special connection with me. My sister is a nurse, she is the first nurse in my family. I look up and admire her strength and bravery so much. I have seen how much she has struggled mentally and physically during this pandemic, and she is one of the strongest personâ€™s I know. I would also love to be a nurse when I grow up so I decided to do this social problem because I would hope that this social problem is implemented and fixed by the time I become a nurse. This is a very important topic so I would really appreciate if you spread the word and help me solve this social problem in my community.
