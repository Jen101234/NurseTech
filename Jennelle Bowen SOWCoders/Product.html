<h1>Social Problem</h1>
  <p class= "socialproblem" >
    There are many problems in the world, especially in the health care system. In my community our charting and filing systems are very out of date. This is a big issue in my country but we can fix it by updating our technology and using coding,  by doing this we will reduce mistakes, reduce cost and much more. It also helps the nurses and staff to not spend so much time charting and searching for files but spend more time dealing with sick patients. My sister is a nurse, and that is why I know how hard and over-whelmed the nurses in my country are, and I am just trying to speak up and help make their jobs easier. I want to be a nurse when I grow up so I can give back to my community, and I would like to help and advocate for this problem now so when I become a nurse this problem will be solved. This is why I find this social problem so important and why it is so personal to me.

  <h1>Benefits if this Problem is Resolved</h1>
  <p class ="AboutProduct">
    My sister is a nurse and as I hear about her day I realized how important and strong these nurses are. They are over doing their 40 hour schedules a week to take care of the Covid-19 patients. As I had mentioned before our healthcare system is out of date and this not only affects the nurses but also us. If we had the proper equipment then the nurse will be able to chart down file and look for a patients past medical file. This benefits us because that means that the nurses can go faster to look for the past files and we, the patients, can meet with the doctors even faster. There are many more benefits by getting technology in our healthcare systems however this is just the main one.
