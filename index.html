<h1>Why healthcare needs Technology</h1>
<!--Paragraph 1-->

  <p class="one">
  While being locked at home during this pandemic I have had a lot of free time to myself. During this free time I have thought of many things, especially social problems of the world, this being said I have also thought of different solutions to solve some of the many problems in the world. During this Covid-19 pandemic the health care system and nurses have been going through a lot of challenges especially now with the surge in Covid-19 cases. Belize is very out of date when it comes to technology involving the charting systems, and patient filing systems. The nurses are very over-whelmed with dealing with all the Covid-19 patients along with other patients they have to take care off. On top of all this they donâ€™t have the resources to chart on computers and to find past patients files . This is why I think it is important that they have the right resources and technology so their work is easier. We as citizens should try an advocate so that our nurses can get the proper technology so their job is easier and that they can take better care of their patients . By trying to speak up for this problem I know that we can help and solve it.
